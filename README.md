# Game of Life
---
# Instructions
***This Game is from the game The Game of Life, Game of Life a cellular automaton invented by the English mathematician John Conway in 1970.***
---
# Rules
***1 The place of action of this game — the "universe" — is a surface or plane marked up into cells — boundless, limited, or closed (in the limit — an infinite plane).***
---
***2 The game stops if:   
1)there won't be a single "live" cell left on the field
2)the configuration at the next step will repeat itself exactly (without shifts and turns) at one of the earlier steps (a periodic configuration is formed)
3)at the next step, none of the cells changes its state (a stable configuration is formed; the previous rule, degenerated to one step back)***
